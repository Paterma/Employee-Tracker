-- need to be able to see the role with employee, need to see dept for creating a role. 
-- need to create helper functions that are getting things out of the database (select all), need to return the array were given back as the choices array in my inquirer question. The only way to see the list is to get it an return it. 
-- dont return the array dynamically- do it with an empty variable [] const role = [], role array is the choices
